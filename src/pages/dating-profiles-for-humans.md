I fully conceptualized, wrote, designed, and edited a digital workbook that walks online daters through the process of writing a dating app profile. True to it’s message of “being yourself and being damn proud of it,” the tone is conversational and relatable. But also in the spirit of straightforward, honest communication, it is clear, efficient, and informative so that daters can get it done and get back to dating.

It only takes 9 steps to make a complete profile, but the content is broken down into 50+ pages. The writing, organization, and visual design work together. They ensure that users will know what to do, why they’re doing it, and most importantly that they have an engaged, confidence-building experience along the way.
